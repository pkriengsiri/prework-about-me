      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've spent the the majority of the past 15 years working in occupational safety and risk mangement consulting, both in the public and private sector.  I've been wanting to make a career change to software development for quite a while, and a slowdown in work due to the pandemic now seems like the perfect time to do it.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in metro Atlanta area but have also spent time living in Nashville, TN and Birmingham, AL.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy cooking and volunteering at the local animal shelter.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Anywhere where I feel engaged in the work, can be a part of a collaborative process, and am able to apply creative problems solving on a daily basis would be ideal.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Midtown Atlanta</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's an area that touches so many facets of our lives, and I like the idea of being apart of providing effective solutions for how people interact with technology. </p>
